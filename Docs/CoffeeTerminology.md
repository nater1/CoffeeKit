# Terminology

The markup document contains coffee terminology to be used in the CoffeeKit app. The purpose of the document is to help with naming conventions.

The terminology is focused on espresso-based coffees. There are a lot of other styles of non-espresso cofee (e.g. filter, Aeropress, iced coffee), which are not currently documented in the summary.

## Coffee styles

All the following coffee styles are hot, espresso-based coffees with 'double' shots (60ml / 2 ounces). The double shot, derived from the Italiano 'doppio', is the typical volume of coffee served in Australian cafes today. Most cafes use between 16-18 grams of coffee to produce a 60ml espresso.

The coffee style names are given below, along with national naming variations, and the list and quantity of ingredients.

## Equipment

The equipment list refers to the component parts of large, commerical espresso machines.

### Group head
The group head is fixed to the body of the espresso machine. The group head is where the pressurised hot water is released from the machine to the portafilter.  

### Portafilter
The portafilter ('portable filter') is comprised of a handle and stainless steel head. It connects to the group head.

### Portafilter basket
The portafilter basket contains the coffee grounds. A typical basket holds 16-18 grams.

### Tamper
The tamper forces the coffee grinds into a solid 'puck' of coffee inside the portafilter. A flat surface ensures the hot water is evenly distributed over the coffee grinds.

### Steam wand
The steam wand is used to heat and froth milk.
